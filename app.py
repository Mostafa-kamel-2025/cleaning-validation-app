🚧 **Cleaning Validation APP by _Gopal Mandloi_** 🚧

**This App is Under Development — Please Read!**

Dear Friends,

Thank you for visiting the MACO Calculation App! This tool is actively being developed and may have bugs — especially in file uploading (templates, multi-file) and result accuracy.  
**Please do not use this app for official or critical calculations at this stage.**

---

**Upcoming Features:**
- Automatic protocol and report generation (PDF)
- One-click calculation and export of all results
- Enhanced automatic result calculation

Once all bugs are fixed, I’ll create a detailed video guide on how to use this app.

---

**🔎 Your Feedback Needed:**  
Please share your expectations, feature requests, or improvement ideas. This helps ensure I address all needs during development.

**🤝 Contributors Welcome:**  
This app is 100% free and built individually with limited resources.  
If you know Python, Java, HTML, or related tech and want to help, please reach out!

With your feedback and support, I’m confident we’ll make this app even better, very soon.

*— Gopal Mandloi*
